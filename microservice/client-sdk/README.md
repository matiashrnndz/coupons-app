# Coupons App  |  SDK Client

## Framework and language

- ***Node.js***: s an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.

- ***Express.js***:  is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js

- ***Javascript***: is a high-level, interpreted scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

## External system dependencies

- ***body-parser***: parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.

- ***express***: fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.

- ***coupons-sdk***: library that helps programmers to use the COUPONS evaluation service in an easy and intuitive way.
